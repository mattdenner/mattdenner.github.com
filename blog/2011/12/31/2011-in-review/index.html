<div class="entry-content"><p>It would be remiss of me not to do a look back over 2011 and to gaze into the future of 2012, seeing as that&#8217;s what people are supposed to do at this
time of year.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>This hasn&#8217;t been my greatest year so far, and I certainly won&#8217;t miss it when it&#8217;s gone tomorrow:</p>

<p>Emotionally it&#8217;s been awful: at the beginning of the year the friendship between my ex-girlfriend and myself became strained and I decided to take a
few months to think about what to do about it.  I ended up in New York for a week trying to sort myself out, which worked out far better than I
expected.  A few weeks after I returned to the UK, in which I gave myself time to be sure that what I&#8217;d decided was the right thing to do, I contacted
her about trying to work things out.  Unfortunately I don&#8217;t feel she saw things the same way, ignoring my attempts to make peace, so in the middle of
the year I decided it was better to not see each other again.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s one of the hardest things I&#8217;ve had to do, especially considering I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her, but when there&#8217;s an imbalance in
any relationship that causes a detriment to your mental health it is better to walk away.  I still think about her, not as much as I used to, and I
wish things had turned out different, but I do not regret my decision in the slightest (ok, the Christmas card from her parents made me feel like a
shit).</p>

<p>The stress at work has been a bit of a rollercoaster over the year: the year started with a promotion, and then another around July, followed by a
hefty piece of work that racked up several weeks of long hours.  But it&#8217;s the end of the year, the last couple of months, that have really pushed me.
The internal piece of software we develop is to be rewritten, from scratch, as the old codebase has become too unwieldy and unmaintainable; as
principle of the team it&#8217;s my responsibility to design, propose, and follow through with a better architecture, which is hard given the responses.
Where I expected the team to be supportive and positive about the situation, given that only a few months ago our jobs were essentially on-the-line, I
was met with disdain and negativity; I thought that people external to the team would fight me at every turn but, instead, they gave positive and
constructive feedback.</p>

<p>The truth is that some in the team have entered the negative mentality associated with a project-death-spiral, and don&#8217;t appear to be able to do
anything about it.  I admit, and anyone who follows me on Twitter will know, that I complain about the state of our code; but given this opportunity
to put some things right, without having to deal with the awful code we have, I relish the chance.  To stand in a room giving a presentation on
the proposed architecture, only to be criticised and not receive any thanks, was demoralising: given I lost ten days worth of holiday to do this
I feel like those people who think it&#8217;s crap, or won&#8217;t work, owe me some of theirs.</p>

<p>Out of these bad things that have been happening I have discovered several things: I&#8217;ve made a couple of good friends over this period, and
that I can count on a friend I&#8217;ve known for the last few years; I&#8217;ve become more sure of my technical self having read and watched stuff on the
internet; and I know that, no matter how dark it can get, there is always something to look forward to.</p>

<p>What does 2012 hold for me?</p>

<p>The rewrite at work is going to be a challenge but I firmly believe it will work out and we&#8217;ll be better off, provided we can ditch all of the
negativity and focus on the opportunity.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to put aside an hour a day where I just do something for myself: given I want to learn Mandarin, and haven&#8217;t been able to find time to do so,
I&#8217;m going to return to that this coming year.  I&#8217;ve already learned <span xml:lang="zh" lang="zh">这需要时间</span>: &#8220;It takes time&#8221;.</p>

<p>With the Olympics arriving in town this summer I guess I&#8217;m going to be heading into London quite a bit over the summer.  I haven&#8217;t got tickets but just
to be around the event will be interesting, and I&#8217;m sure there will be a lot happening.  I completely expect a couple of themed street skates!</p>

<p>And I&#8217;m already looking into heading back to New York and debating a trip to the west coast towards the end of the year.</p>
