<p>I can&#39;t move forward without looking back over 2013 and picking out my highlights.</p>

<h3>Cochlear implant</h3>

<p><b>My girlfriend was deaf</b>: she now has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant">cochlear implant</a>
which actually gives her better hearing than mine!  The device is incredibly simple in one theory: a
microphone picks up the sounds, a processor converts them into a signal that is broadcast across a
narrow gap to a receiver buried under the scalp, which converts that signal into electrical pulses to
the 24 electrodes implanted inside her cochlear into the auditory nerve.  But the technology is
actually incredibly remarkable: adaptive sounds processing, noise cancellation, narrow field
sensors.  And she was one of, if not the first, people to get the <a href="http://www.cochlear.com/wps/wcm/connect/intl/home/discover/cochlear-implants/the-nucleus-6-system-/">Cochlear Nucleus 6</a>
in the UK.</p>

<p>That I can now hold a conversation, somewhat staccato, <b>between rooms with someone who only 9
months ago would have to be looking at me to lipread</b> is a stunning testament to this device.
It&#39;s not perfect but I&#39;ve seen a dramatic change in her since the operation and I know that the
effort she has, and will, put into this will cause even more surprise in 2014.</p>

<p>Having watched her go through all of this I was even more sure of how I felt, <b>so I proposed</b>.
I did it in totally the wrong way, because of pressures from a situation I had put myself in, but I
know that I want to spend the rest of my life with her.  She&#39;s an amazing person and I can&#39;t believe
how lucky I have been to end up in this wonderful relationship.</p>

<p>At the moment our plans are a bit loose, in that we had planned to marry in 2015, but we&#39;re sure of
our guest list, the theme of the wedding, and where in the country it will be; plus she&#39;s bought her
wedding dress already!  So we are both working towards a wedding in 2014, if we can sort out a
venue.</p>

<h3>Changing jobs</h3>

<p>Way back in 2010 I moved back into IT from the world of teaching skating and ended up working for a
great company.  I thoroughly enjoyed my time there up until the beginning of 2013, when things took
a change for the worse from my perspective: I found my skills drying up and it harder and harder to
work with some of the people around me.</p>

<p>So I went looking for another job early in the year.  However, with my girlfriend getting her
implant around the same time, I found myself under too much pressure &amp; stress to be able to support
her and look for the job.  So I gave up looking and decided to ride things out.</p>

<p>Eventually I lucked out and, on checking up on an earlier application that I&#39;d made, I was brought
in for an interview a <a href="http://www.uswitch.com/">uSwitch</a>.  The surprising thing was that the
technical section of my interview was done in <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>, a language I had only
picked up a few months before, and I was really pleased with how I presented myself.</p>

<p>They offered me a position and, after a nasty two month notice period, I started in November.  I
have to be perfectly frank: I really took the job to get away from where I was and had no idea
whether it would suit me.  I figured that anything was better than where I was.  But I have to
admit: <b>everyone at uSwitch is extremely talented and strongly skilled, and I&#39;ve been incredibly
fortunate to end up here</b>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m working mainly in <a href="http://rubylang.org/">Ruby</a> and doing lots of front-end work (HTML &amp;
Javascript), but also get a chance to do Clojure every-now-and-then too.  In the two months I&#39;ve
been there, and with only a month until my probation ends, I&#39;ve learnt an incredible amount of
stuff.  The most positive of these is that <b>if you organise your team around a product, with
people from all departments, you get a very focused and agile group</b>.  Where, in larger
companies, I&#39;ve always felt that you are doing a job, here I feel like my voice counts and that I&#39;m
invested in what it is we are trying to achieve.</p>

<h3>Where to in 2014</h3>

<p>What am I going to be doing in 2014?  Well, I&#39;m setting myself a few personal challenges that I&#39;m
really going to stick to as best as possible:</p>

<p>I was amazed that my Dad can list all of the countries in Africa, even the odd ones, so I&#39;ve decided
to one-up him and <b>learn to place all of the countries of the world</b>.  I&#39;m aware that
<i>country</i> is probably a bit of a loose term, but for the moment I&#39;m planning on all of the
stable countries plus some of the recent break aways.</p>

<p>This blog was poorly thought out and badly executed the first time round, so <b>I&#39;m going to be
writing one article every week</b>.  I have no idea what I&#39;m going to write about at the moment,
although I suspect there will be lots on my progress through these challenges as well as stuff that
comes up from work that might be interesting.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always wanted to learn a musical instrument, originally the piano, so in 2014 I&#39;ve set myself the
goal of <b>learning the guitar</b>.  When I say <i>learning</i> I mean be proficient enough to pick
up a music book and play it; I&#39;m not aiming for greatness, just the ability to play.  To do this I&#39;m
thinking of getting <a href="http://rocksmith.ubi.com/rocksmith/en-GB/home/index.aspx">Rocksmith</a> and buying
an <a href="http://www.epiphone.com/Products/Designer/Nighthawk-Custom-Reissue.aspx">Epiphone Nighthawk Custom Reissue</a>,
although that might be a bit much!  And yes, I will be trying for the <i>60 Day Challenge</i>.</p>

<p>At the start of 2013 I was running about 4 miles every couple of days; by the end of 2013 I wasn&#39;t.
I regret this a lot, especially after joining uSwitch and ending up so close to <a href="http://boroughmarket.org.uk/">Burrough Market</a>,
so now I am going to work towards being able to <b>run the 10 miles from the office to home</b>.
Having gone from zero to 4 miles in only a few months at the end of 2012 I feel that I should be
able to do the full distance before summer.</p>

<p><b>Finally, and most importantly, I&#39;m going to get the wedding sorted and done.</b></p>
